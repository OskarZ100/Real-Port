## HELLO 
this is a much more in detail portfolio website i made
i have never wrote as much css code as i did here i have learnt alot from this
a lot of the CSS code can be optimized which i plan on getting to in the future
this is also the first time i have tried to scale items to fit on various screens

## RUN INSTRUCTIONS
can run by downlaoding files and running locally but soon i plan to host this website
and put it up online

## INSPIRATION
i was heavily inspired by retro sort of style on this hence the pixelated font and 
undertale style buttons 
i really wanted something that would pop out to the user 

# ENJOY !
